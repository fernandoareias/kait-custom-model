# KAIT Debugging Session

## Problem Statement

A Service in the hosting Namespace is not responding to requests. Determine which Service is not working and resolve the underlying issue so the Service begins responding to requests.

## Analysis and Resolution

To diagnose and resolve the issue of a non-responsive Service in the Kubernetes cluster, we will follow the steps outlined. Let's start by identifying the Services and their corresponding Pods in the hosting Namespace.

### Step 1: List Services in the Namespace

First, we will list all the Services in the namespace to identify which one may be problematic.

```bash
kubectl get services -n default
```

**Reasoning**: This command lists all the Services in the "default" namespace (you can replace "default" with the actual namespace if it's different). It provides information about their ClusterIP, type, and endpoints, which is crucial for identifying any Services that may not have healthy endpoints.

### Step 2: Describe the Potentially Affected Service

Once we identify the Service that might be having issues, we will describe it to check its status and endpoints.

Assuming we suspect a Service named `my-service`, we run:

```bash
kubectl describe service my-service -n default
```

**Reasoning**: This command provides detailed information about the Service, including its endpoints, which tell us if any Pods are currently backing the Service. If the endpoints are empty or have no healthy Pods, the Service won't respond to requests.

### Step 3: Check the Pods Backing the Service

Next, we need to check the Pods associated with the Service to see if they are running properly.

First, we find the Pods by checking the selectors used in the Service:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n default --selector=app=my-app
```

**Reasoning**: Assuming the Service has a selector for Pods labeled with `app=my-app`, this command will list all the Pods that should be part of the Service. If there are no Pods listed or they are in a crash loop or pending state, we need to investigate further.

### Step 4: Describe the Pods

If we find Pods that are not running or in an error state, we need to describe one of them to understand the issue.

Assuming we find a Pod named `my-app-1234`, we run:

```bash
kubectl describe pod my-app-1234 -n default
```

**Reasoning**: This command provides detailed information about the Pod's status, events, and conditions that might indicate why the Pod is not running correctly, such as crash reasons or image pull errors.

### Step 5: Check the Logs of the Pod

If the Pod is running but still not responding, we should check its logs to identify any application-level issues.

```bash
kubectl logs my-app-1234 -n default --tail=10
```

**Reasoning**: This command fetches the most recent logs from the specified Pod. Reviewing the logs will help us identify any application errors or exceptions that could be causing the Service to be unresponsive.

### Step 6: Apply Fixes Based on Findings

Assuming we find that the Pod is crashing due to a missing environment variable, we can fix this by updating the Deployment or StatefulSet managing the Pods. For instance, if we need to set an environment variable, we could use:

```bash
kubectl set env deployment/my-app DEPLOYMENT_ENV=production -n default
```

**Reasoning**: This command updates the environment variable for the Deployment. Make sure to adjust the variable name and value as needed based on the findings from the logs or Pod description.

### Step 7: Rollout the Changes

After updating the environment variable, we need to ensure that the Deployment is rolled out properly:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app -n default
```

**Reasoning**: This command checks the status of the rollout to ensure that the Deployment is successfully updated and the Pods are running.

### Step 8: Verify the Service is Responding

Finally, we can check if the Service is now responding by querying its endpoints again:

```bash
kubectl get endpoints my-service -n default
```

**Reasoning**: This command checks if the Service now has healthy endpoints. If the endpoints list shows the Pods, the Service should be responding to requests.

### Conclusion

Following these steps, we have diagnosed the issue with the Service, identified the root cause through checking Pods and logs, applied the necessary fixes, and verified that the Service is now functioning properly.
